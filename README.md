WSDL X10 demo

This project is a demo of how to interface the Weather Station Data Logger (WSDL)(http://wmrx00.sourceforge.net/) 
to X10 home automation controls.  X10 is one of the oldest home automation protocols dating back to the 1970's.  

This project depends on the SSDL-Plugin-Demo inclided in the WSDL project. This is included in the source code download for WSDL.  Add WSDL-Custom-Client-Demo folder to the same level as this project in your folder structure.

This project demonstrates the interface to WSDL as well as interfacing X10 modules.  It was made for somewhat specific use cases so it is more of an example than something you just download and run.  The X10 interface requires that you have X10 Active Home and the related CM15A X10 control module ( http://www.x10.com/cm15a-module.html ) in order to issue X10 commands.
